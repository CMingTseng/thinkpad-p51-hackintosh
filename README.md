| MEMORY | 1x16GB | FULL | |
| DISPLAY | 4K | FULL | |
| STORAGE | Samsung NVMe 256GB | FULL | |
| ETHERNET | Intel I219-V | FULL | https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/intel-i219-ethernet-drivers-for-skylake-100-series-motherboards-testing.180995/ |
| WLAN | Intel AC8265 | NO | To be replaced with BCM94352Z with FULL compatibility |
| BLUETOOTH | Intel AC8265 | YES | Fixes needed to make it work fully. To be replaced with BCM94352Z with FULL compatibility |
| EXPRESS CARD | | NO | Needs to be disabled for power consumption reasons through ACPI SSDT patches |
| SD READER | Realtek RTS525A | YES | Driver in the works https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/321080-sineteks-driver-for-realtek-rtsx-sdhc-card-readers/, until the driver is 100% complete and bugfree this component will be disabled for power consumption reasons |
| PORTS | 4xUSB3.1 Gen 1 | YES | Need to be correctly setup through USBInjectAll.kext + custom SSDT |
| | 1xUSB C (Thunderbolt) | ? | Needs to be correctly tested and setup as above. Thunderbolt will probably never work (but I have hope: https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-dell-xps-15-9560-4k-touch-1tb-ssd-32gb-ram-100-adobergb.224486/), but USB C yes, objective is to make it a substitute for HDMI/Mini Displayport/VGA through Macbook cable adapters. Example of this: https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/xps-9360-usb-c-to-hdmi-audio-still-not-working.216140/|
| | HDMI 1.4b | NO:DISABLED | Since Nvidia is disabled, this port connected to it can't work |
| | Mini Displayport 1.2a | NO:DISABLED | Since Nvidia is disabled, this port connected to it can't work |
| CAMERA | | FULL | |
| AUDIO | ALC3268 (Speakers + Internal Mic + Headphone/Mic Combo) | FULL | AppleALC.kect + Layout #29 as per: https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/4e23w6/guide_native_audio_with_clover_applealckext/ |
| KEYBOARD | | YES | Some keys need to be fixed/setup with SSDT patches, especially leds |
| ULTRANAV | Trackpoint | YES | Needs to be fixed: movement is not smooth (it's blocky/jumpy). Also, center trackpoint button should be fixed since it's imprecise. |
| | Touchpad | YES | See if it is possible to add more gestures |
| FP READER | | YES | USB device: needs to be disabled through USBInjectAll.kext + custom SSDT since not used to preserve battery |
| COLOR CALIBRATOR | | YES | USB device: needs to be disabled through USBInjectAll.kext + custom SSDT since not used to preserve battery |

## Software:

## Guide:
1) MOST IMPORTANT: https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-booting-the-os-x-installer-on-laptops-with-clover.148093/
2) Rest of the guide is under construction. Also waiting to reach complete compatibility.

## Benchmarks & Optimizations:

I've run some benchmarks and the results are slightly better than on Windows, since OSX has less rogue processes eating CPU computational power:
### CPU:
- Cinebench: 730
- Geekbench 4: SC: 4611, MC: 13317 (I have single channel ram which means lower memory bandwidth and lower multicore score) https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/8700946

### Battery:
Following the Notebookcheck battery test (example: https://www.notebookcheck.net/Apple-MacBook-Pro-15-2017-2-8-GHz-555-Laptop-Review.230096.0.html) my P51 got 9 hours of usage on the Big Buck Bunny h.264 1080p test at 150 nits (50% of the P51 4K brightness) in airplane mode (basically wifi disabled, for now). This score is slightly better than the Macbook Pro 15 2017 since the P51 has a bigger battery, but also has a display with 50% more pixels, so the advantage over the Macbook Pro is pretty much canceled. Battery should improve significantly once USB injection is correctly adapted to our system. Until now USB ports work, but not optimally. Some components, like the X-Rite calibrator, the FP scanner, the SD card reader, the Express Card slot are always on and consume power, so they will be disabled. Objective is to increase battery time of the test above from 9+ hours to about 10+ hours if possible.

### Optimizations:
With the use of VoltageShift (https://github.com/sicreative/VoltageShift) I was able to undervolt the i7-7700HQ and lower max temperatures by 10Â°C and package power by about 10W. Since the temperature is overall lower, the fans spin less and there is less noise. Another tool similar to VoltageShift is Volta (http://volta.garymathews.com/) but it's a paid program.
Another thing I'm searching for is Thinkpad specific fan control, but this would probably require porting Windows or GNU/Linux existing code (Tpfancontrol for example).
