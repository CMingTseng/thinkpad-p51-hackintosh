Once everything in this list is solved, the P51 hackintosh would be pretty much complete with everything working except discrete GPU (HDMI & DP), Express Card and SD Reader (for now, until the driver is finished).

- Fix coreaudio? At 128smp, for example, FL Studio 20 Newstuff.flp lags a lot, with a lot of cpu usage. Also, audio crackles when moving windows while playing music on FL and Ableton.
- Fix bluetooth & Wifi Broadcom (see sleep issue with bluetooth)
- Fix keyboard keys and toggle leds with mute/unmute/volume actions:
  - Volume toggle left: e020=4a down, _Q43: toggle works and LED works, but muting sound from settings don't change LED status
  - Volume down left: e02e=49 down, not recognized
  - Volume up left: e030=48 down, not recognized
  - Numlock: 45=47 down, not recognized: doesn't work as supposed and LED doesn't toggle
  - Mic toggle: _Q6A
  - Brightness up: _Q14
  - Brightness down: _Q15
  - Mirror screen: _Q16
  - Toggle wifi: _Q64
  - Settings: _Q66
  - Toggle bluetooth: _Q60
  - Keyboard: _Q61
  - Favorite: _Q62
- Setup USB C hotplug
- Wrong battery percentage reported by both HWMonitor and system battery (it seems HWMonitor is considering the battery design capacity instead of the battery max capacity)
- Tune trackpoint: smoother precision and calibrate center button for scrolling
- Tune touchpad + setup gestures (if possible)
- Setup iMessage & Co
- Disable Express Card? (for power consumption reasons, but maybe it's already disabled at boot)
- Disable SD Reader? (for power consumption reasons, but maybe it's already disabled at boot)
